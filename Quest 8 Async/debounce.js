// Create two functions that will work like _.debounce from lodash.

// debounce: don't worry about the options.
// opDebounce: implement the leading options.

// In JavaScript, debouncing is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function gets called or executed. 
// It can be implemented by creating a wrapper function that calls the original function, 
// but only after a certain amount of time has passed since the last time the wrapper function was invoked.

// A common way to implement debouncing in JavaScript is to use setTimeout() and clearTimeout() functions. 
// The basic idea is to have a timer that starts running when the wrapper function is called, 
// and if the function is called again before the timer expires, the timer is reset, and the original function is 
// not called until the timer expires.

// Here is an example of a debounced function in JavaScript:

// Code
// function debounce(fn, delay) {
//   let timeoutId;
//   return function() {
//     clearTimeout(timeoutId);
//     timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
//       fn.apply(this, arguments);
//     }, delay);
//   }
// }
// In this example, the debounce function takes two arguments: the first is the original function that you want to debounce, 
// and the second is the delay in milliseconds. The debounce function returns a new function that can be 
// called in place of the original function.

// When the new function is called, it clears any existing timer using clearTimeout() and starts a new timer using setTimeout(). 
// The original function is called only when the timer expires. 
// If the new function is called again before the timer expires, the timer is reset, 
// and the original function is not called until the new timer expires.

// You can use the debounced function like this:

// Code
// const debouncedFunction = debounce(yourFunction, 500);
// This will create a new function debouncedFunction that will call yourFunction only once every 500 milliseconds.

// It's important to note that debouncing can have its own trade-offs, 
// like it may delay the execution of the function and also it may introduce a delay in the response time of the user interface.


// clearTimeout() and setTimeout() are two JavaScript functions that are used to control the timing of function execution.

// setTimeout(func, delay) is a function that schedules a function, func, 
// to be executed after a specified delay, delay, in milliseconds. 
// The function returns a timeout ID, which can be used to cancel the timeout using clearTimeout(timeoutId).

// clearTimeout(timeoutId) is a function that cancels a scheduled timeout identified by the timeoutId returned by setTimeout(). 
// If a timeout with that timeoutId does not exist, the function does nothing.

// When the time specified in the setTimeout() function elapses, the function passed to setTimeout() is executed once.

// You can use setTimeout() to schedule a function to be executed after a certain amount of time has passed. 
// This can be useful for creating timed events, such as animations, or for delaying the execution of a function to 
// improve performance or to prevent a function from being called too frequently.

// clearTimeout() is used to cancel a scheduled timeout before it's executed, 
// it's useful to stop the execution of a function that was scheduled with setTimeout() but it's not needed anymore.

// For example, you might use setTimeout() to schedule a function that updates the position of an element on the 
// screen every 100 milliseconds, and use clearTimeout() to stop the animation when the user navigates to a 
// different page or when the animation reaches the end.

const debounce = (func, timer) => {
  let sleep;
  return function () {
    clearTimeout(sleep);
    sleep = setTimeout(func, timer);
  };
};
function opDebounce(fn, wait, options = { leading: false }) {
  let timeout;
  return function () {
    const context = this;
    const args = arguments;
    if (!timeout && options.leading) {
      fn.apply(context, args);
    }
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      if (!options.leading) {
        fn.apply(context, args);
      }
      timeout = null;
    }, wait);
  };
}
