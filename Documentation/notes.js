//                                                 CURRYING
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Currying is a functional programming technique that involves breaking down a function that
// takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument.
// The term "currying" is derived from the mathematician Haskell Curry, who first developed the concept.

// For example, consider a function add that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns their sum:

// Code
// function add(x, y) {
//   return x + y;
// }
// console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5

// We can "curry" this function to create a new function addX that takes a single
// argument y and returns a new function that takes a single argument x and returns the sum of x and y:

// Code
// function addX(x) {
//   return function(y) {
//     return x + y;
//   }
// }
// const add2 = addX(2);
// console.log(add2(3)); // 5

// In this example, addX is a curried version of the add function.
// The benefit of currying is that it allows you to create new functions with some of the arguments
// already "filled in," which can make your code more reusable and easier to reason about.

// Some programming languages, such as Haskell, automatically curry all functions, while others,
// such as JavaScript, do not. However, it's possible to curry functions in JavaScript by using closures,
// as shown in the example above.

// It's also important to note that not every function can be curried, and not all functional programming
// languages automatically curry all functions. Some functions may have an arity (number of expected arguments)
// that cannot be expressed in the curried form, which is the case with functions that take a variable number of arguments.


//                                                 COMPOSITION
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Composition is a functional programming technique that involves combining two or more functions
// to produce a new function. The new function takes the output of one function as its input, and
// the output of the new function is the input of the next function, and so on.

// For example, consider the following functions:

// Code
// function add(x, y) {
//   return x + y;
// }
// function square(x) {
//   return x * x;
// }

// We can compose these two functions to create a new function that adds two numbers and then squares the result:

// Code
// function addAndSquare(x, y) {
//   return square(add(x, y));
// }
// console.log(addAndSquare(2, 3)); // 25

// In this example, the addAndSquare function is a composition of the add and square functions.
// The benefit of composition is that it allows you to create new functions from existing functions,
// which can make your code more reusable and easier to reason about.

// Some programming languages, such as Haskell, automatically compose all functions, while others,
// such as JavaScript, do not. However, it's possible to compose functions in JavaScript by using closures,
// as shown in the example above.

// It's also important to note that not every function can be composed, and not all functional programming
// languages automatically compose all functions. Some functions may have an arity (number of expected arguments)
// that cannot be expressed in the composed form, which is the case with functions that take a variable number of arguments.


//                                                 RECURSION
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Recursion is a programming technique that involves a function calling itself directly or indirectly.
// The function that calls itself is called the recursive function, and the process can be repeated as many times as necessary.

// For example, consider the following function that calculates the factorial of a number:

// Code
// function factorial(n) {
//   if (n === 0) {
//     return 1;
//   }
//   return n * factorial(n - 1);
// }
// console.log(factorial(5)); // 120

// In this example, the factorial function is a recursive function that calls itself until it reaches the base case,
// where n is equal to 0. The benefit of recursion is that it allows you to solve problems that can be broken down
// into smaller versions of the same problem, which can make your code more reusable and easier to reason about.

// Some programming languages, such as Haskell, automatically recurse all functions, while others,
// such as JavaScript, do not. However, it's possible to recurse functions in JavaScript by using closures,
// as shown in the example above.

// It's also important to note that not every function can be recursed, and not all functional programming
// languages automatically recurse all functions. Some functions may have an arity (number of expected arguments)
// that cannot be expressed in the recursed form, which is the case with functions that take a variable number of arguments.


//                                                 HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments,
// or returns a function as its result.

// For example, consider the following functions:

// Code
// function add(x, y) {
//   return x + y;
// }
// function square(x) {
//   return x * x;
// }

// We can pass the add and square functions as arguments to the map function, which is a higher-order function:

// Code
// const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
// const addAndSquare = numbers.map(function(number) {
//   return square(add(number, number));
// });
// console.log(addAndSquare); // [4, 16, 36]

// In this example, the map function is a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument.
// The benefit of higher-order functions is that they allow you to create new functions from existing functions,
// which can make your code more reusable and easier to reason about.

// Some programming languages, such as Haskell, automatically higher-order all functions, while others,
// such as JavaScript, do not. However, it's possible to higher-order functions in JavaScript by using closures,
// as shown in the example above.

// It's also important to note that not every function can be higher-ordered, and not all functional programming
// languages automatically higher-order all functions. Some functions may have an arity (number of expected arguments)
// that cannot be expressed in the higher-ordered form, which is the case with functions that take a variable number of arguments.


//                                                 IMMUTABILITY
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Immutability is a functional programming technique that involves creating new data instead of modifying existing data.

// For example, consider the following function that adds a new item to an array:

// Code
// function addItem(array, item) {
//   array.push(item);
//   return array;
// }
// const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
// const newNumbers = addItem(numbers, 4);
// console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3]
// console.log(newNumbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// In this example, the addItem function is not immutable because it modifies the numbers array.
// The benefit of immutability is that it allows you to create new data without modifying existing data,
// which can make your code more reusable and easier to reason about.

// Some programming languages, such as Haskell, automatically immutable all functions, while others,
// such as JavaScript, do not. However, it's possible to immutable functions in JavaScript by using closures,
// as shown in the example above.

// It's also important to note that not every function can be immutable, and not all functional programming
// languages automatically immutable all functions. Some functions may have an arity (number of expected arguments)
// that cannot be expressed in the immutable form, which is the case with functions that take a variable number of arguments.


//                                                 PURE FUNCTIONS
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A pure function is a function that has no side effects and always returns the same result given the same arguments.

// For example, consider the following function that adds two numbers:

// Code
// function add(x, y) {
//   return x + y;
// }
// console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5

// In this example, the add function is a pure function because it has no side effects and always returns the same result given the same arguments.
// The benefit of pure functions is that they allow you to create new data without modifying existing data,
// which can make your code more reusable and easier to reason about.

// Some programming languages, such as Haskell, automatically pure all functions, while others,
// such as JavaScript, do not. However, it's possible to pure functions in JavaScript by using closures,
// as shown in the example above.

// It's also important to note that not every function can be pure, and not all functional programming
// languages automatically pure all functions. Some functions may have an arity (number of expected arguments)
// that cannot be expressed in the pure form, which is the case with functions that take a variable number of arguments.


//                                                 FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Functional programming is a programming paradigm that uses functions to create new data instead of modifying existing data.

// For example, consider the following functions:

// Code
// function add(x, y) {
//   return x + y;
// }
// function square(x) {
//   return x * x;
// }
// function compose(f, g) {
//   return function(x) {
//     return f(g(x));
//   };
// }
// const addAndSquare = compose(square, add);
// console.log(addAndSquare(2, 3)); // 25

// In this example, the add, square, and compose functions are all functional programming functions.
// The benefit of functional programming is that it allows you to create new data without modifying existing data,
// which can make your code more reusable and easier to reason about.

// Some programming languages, such as Haskell, automatically functional programming all functions, while others,

//                                                 OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects to create new data instead of modifying existing data.

// For example, consider the following objects:

// Code
// const add = {
//   x: 2,
//   y: 3,
//   result: function() {
//     return this.x + this.y;
//   }
// };
// const square = {
//   x: 2,
//   result: function() {
//     return this.x * this.x;
//   }
// };
// const addAndSquare = {
//   x: add.result(),
//   result: function() {
//     return square.result();
//   }
// };
// console.log(addAndSquare.result()); // 25

// In this example, the add, square, and addAndSquare objects are all object-oriented programming objects.
// The benefit of object-oriented programming is that it allows you to create new data without modifying existing data,
// which can make your code more reusable and easier to reason about.

// Some programming languages, such as Java, automatically object-oriented programming all objects, while others,

// It's also important to note that not every object can be object-oriented programming, and not all object-oriented programming
// languages automatically object-oriented programming all objects. Some objects may have an arity (number of expected arguments)
