In JavaScript, an if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true. 
The syntax for an if statement is as follows:

Code
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
}
The condition is an expression that is evaluated to a boolean value (either true or false). 
If the condition is true, the code inside the curly braces { } is executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the curly braces is skipped.

Here is an example of an if statement in action:

Code
const x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
  console.log('x is greater than 5');
}

// Output: 'x is greater than 5'
In this example, the condition x > 5 is true because the value of x is 10, which is greater than 5. 
Therefore, the code inside the curly braces is executed and the string 'x is greater than 5' is logged to the console.

You can also add an else clause to an if statement to execute a block of code if the condition is false:

Code
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if condition is false
}
Here is an example that uses an else clause:

Code
const x = 10;

if (x > 15) {
  console.log('x is greater than 15');
} else {
  console.log('x is not greater than 15');
}

// Output: 'x is not greater than 15'
In this example, the condition x > 15 is false because the value of x is 10, which is not greater than 15. 
Therefore, the code inside the else block is executed and the string 'x is not greater than 15' is logged to the console.

You can also add multiple else if clauses to check for multiple conditions:

Code
if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if all conditions are false
}
Here is an example that uses else if clauses:

Code
const x = 10;

if (x > 15) {
  console.log('x is greater than 15');
} else if (x > 5) {
  console.log('x is greater than 5 but not greater than 15');
} else {
  console.log('x is not greater than 5');
}

// Output: 'x is greater than 5 but not greater than 15'
In this example, the first condition x > 15 is false, so the code inside the corresponding block is skipped. 
The second condition x > 5 is true, so the code inside that block is executed and the string 'x is greater than 5 but not greater than 15' is logged to the console
